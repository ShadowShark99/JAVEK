## Inspiration
Many people, especially students, have trouble focusing on what needs to be done. Whether they end up checking other tabs on their computer, being unable to study for a set amount of time, or have little motivation to do so.

To help increase human productivity, we have created a web app. D.U.C.K, which stands for

D - Digital 
U - Useful
C - Companion
K - Keeper

Inspired by the reliable coding debugging rubber ducks who work alongside programmers, D.U.C.K uses Samba_Nova’s ai to help students study and learn without switching tabs so that they can truly focus.
## What it does
D.U.C.K uses Samba_Nova’s ai to help students study and learn without switching tabs so that they can truly focus. Additionally the implementation of a timer allows for users to focus studying for a desired time. When the timer ends, the web app will immediately send a link to a NY Times game as a reward for the student completing a study break. 

## How we built it
With using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Firebase, and the Samba-Nova API.
## Challenges we ran into
Incorporating Firebase was a challenge for us as our team did not have any past back-end experience. Despite spending many hours on this, we decided to switch our focus more on the execution of our front end. We also had difficulties incorporating a timer into our UI as we had little JavaScript experience, however we were able to successfully incorporate it into our web app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating the front end, timer, and the idea during a short span of time.

## What we learned
We learned more about how the front end works with the back end. Even through difficult challenges, we found ourselves more capable than we expected in solving problems with our web app such as the incorporation of the timer in JavaScript despite our limited experience.

## What's next for Project Hackathon
Better timer functionality, an addition of the API and the game reward for completing a study session.
